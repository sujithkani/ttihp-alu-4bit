## How it works

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting seven basic operations:

- **Addition** (A + B)
- **Subtraction** (A - B)
- **Bitwise AND** (A & B)
- **Bitwise OR** (A | B)
- **Bitwise XOR** (A ^ B)
- **Bitwise NOT** (~A)
- **Pass-through B**

Inputs `A` and `B` are each 4-bit operands, supplied via the `ui_in` input bus. The operation to be performed is selected by a 3-bit `opcode`, provided via the lower bits of the bidirectional `uio_in` bus.
The result is output via the `uo_out` bus:
- `uo[7:4]` = 4-bit result
- `uo[0]` = Carry-out (for addition or subtraction)
Unused output bits (`uo[3:1]`) are reserved and not driven.

## How to test

To test the 4-bit ALU, follow these steps:
1. **Provide operands:**
   - Assign the 4-bit operand `A` to `ui[7:4]`
   - Assign the 4-bit operand `B` to `ui[3:0]`

2. **Select operation using `uio[2:0]`:**
   | Opcode | Operation     |
   |--------|---------------|
   | `000`  | A + B         |
   | `001`  | A - B         |
   | `010`  | A & B         |
   | `011`  | A \| B        |
   | `100`  | A ^ B         |
   | `101`  | ~A            |
   | `110`  | B (pass-through) |
   | `111`  | Reserved      |

3. **Observe outputs:**
   - `uo[7:4]` shows the result
   - `uo[0]` gives the carry-out
   - `uo[3:1]` are unused

**Example:**
To compute `A = 0b1010`, `B = 0b0011`, and perform addition (`opcode = 000`):
- Set `ui = 0b10100011`
- Set `uio[2:0] = 3'b000`
- Result = `0b1101` â†’ appears on `uo[7:4]`
- If carry-out = 0, `uo[0] = 0`

## External hardware
This project does not require any external hardware.
Inputs and outputs are entirely digital and accessible via the standard TinyTapeout I/O pads.
